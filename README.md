- List all files containing user-defined extension (.czi .zvi or .tif) within selected directory and sub-directories
- Apply the user-defined threshold (default 290) then analyse particles above the threshold
- Group all pixels above the threshold in one Region Of Interest and save this ROI in a zip file within work directory
- Open images one by one to check the auto-selected area
- User can confirm the ROI, modify it directly or remove image from further analysis
- result table is automatically copied to clipboard at the end of the macro
